  Although the sport of boxing is not as popular as it once was in the days of Muhammad Ali, It is slowly picking up traction from well known influencers such as Jake Paul. I've recently started boxing and have found out how much training needs to be done to be in shape for the sport. Maybe that is a reason why boxing isn't one of the sports teens are regularly taking apart in.
